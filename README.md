# You should use code only when you understand them

### This repository is a collection of libraries of different modules

You may download the whole repository as a zip to your local drive, and then open your Arduino IDE.

Select from the IDE's toolbar: Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP library... -> and select the folder containing a desired module, maybe like Us_016



Then you can use the library of the desired module.

You may like to see the examples of the modules to get a better understanding on how to use them.

To do so, select from the IDE's toolbar: File -> Examples -> (Scroll to the bottom) and select the library name of the module you have added to Arduino IDE just now.



If you find any problems with my code (or face any difficulties), please contact me at yhei.choi@gmail.com.
